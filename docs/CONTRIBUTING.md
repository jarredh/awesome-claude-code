# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

Please take a moment to read through this docoument if you plan to submit something for recommendation.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to recent activity that is visible across various repositories, stricter measures have been put in place to reduce spam. Policies have changed very little, only their enforcement will be much stricter going forward, and I will have little patience for anyone who neglects to read this document before opening an issue. Please see [COOLDOWN](./COOLDOWN.md) for additional information.

- I am very grateful to receive recommendations from the visitors to this list. But be aware that there is no formal submission/review process at the moment. My responsibility is to share links to awesome things. One way I find out about awesome things is via the repo's issues, and I'm very grateful to everyone who shares their amazing work. But it's not the only way, and creating an issue does not represent any sort of contract.
- Bear in mind that the point of an Awesome List is to be *selective* - I cannot recommend every single resource that is submitted.
- The goal of this list is to identify and highlight resources that provide value to the Claude Code community - not the other way around. Please do not create any repositories just so that you can submit them to this list. And don't plan a marketing strategy that has anything to do with being added to the list.
- I prioritize the following above all: ***security***. Usually, I have to run the software in order to know if it's any good. And I am not content to recommend something unless I have high confidence that it is not malicious or overly risky - and that any risks (permissions, etc.) are prominently declared.
- Understand that I am not going to download and execute a shell script or a binary unless I have high confidence that it is safe to do so. The longer the shell script is, the less likely that I'm going to execute it. Also bear in mind that I am probably not going to devote an entire week to ramping up on a specialized framework.

If getting a review from the maintainer is important to you, here are some things that might help:

- What I tend to prioritize: projects that are (i) easy to try out and show their value immediately; (ii) projects with great documentation (especially demos); (iii) projects that easy to spin up and tear down (and even better if they don't touch any core directories); (iv) projects that are unique or creative; (v) projects that are "interoperable" - meaning, resources that users can adapt to their own workflow, rather than ones that require total buy-in.
- Try to make it as easy and as fast as possible for the user to see the value in your software. If you make bold claims, you must be prepared to offer clear and convincing evidence. Tell me exactly what task I should give to Claude and what prompts I should use.

## How to Recommend a Resource

**NOTE: ALL RECOMMENDATIONS MUST BE MADE USING THE WEB UI ISSUE FORM TEMPLATE, OR YOU RISK BEING BANNED FROM INTERACTING WITH THIS REPOSITORY TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY.**

First, make sure you've read the above information. Second, make sure you've read, and agree with, the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) Then:

### **[Click here to submit a new resource](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new?template=recommend-resource.yml)**

That's it! Just click the link above and fill out the form. You don't even need to use git. (And please don't open a PR for this.)

> [!Warning]
> It is **not** possible to submit a resource recommendation using the `gh` CLI.

Resource recommendations must be created by human beings.

### The Recommendation Process

The entire recommendation process is managed via automation - even the maintainer does not use PRs to add entries to the list. The bot is really good at it. Here's what happens when you submit a resource for recommendation:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[📝 Fill out recommendation form] --> B[🤖 Automated validation]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|❌ No| D[Bot comments with issues]
    D --> E[Edit your submission]
    E --> B
    C -->|✅ Yes| F[Awaits maintainer review]
    F --> G{Decision}
    G -->|👍 Approved| H[Bot creates PR automatically]
    G -->|🔄 Changes requested| I[Maintainer requests changes]
    G -->|👎 Rejected| J[Issue closed with reason]
    I --> E
    H --> K[PR merged]
    K --> L[🎉 Resource goes live!]
    L --> M[You receive notification]
```

### What the Bot Validates

When you submit a resource, the bot checks:

- All required fields are filled
- URLs are valid and accessible
- No duplicate resources exist
- License information (when available)
- Description length and quality

The bot's validation is not any sort of review. It's merely a formal check.
